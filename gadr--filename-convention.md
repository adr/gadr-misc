# Filename convention

## Context and Problem Statement

Which naming convention should be used for graphics in websites?

## Considered Options

* [Camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) without project name prefix
* [Dasherization  without project name prefix](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/104468/if-this-is-camelcase-what-is-this/104476#104476) without project name prefix
* Camel case with project name prefix
* Dasherization with project name prefix


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Camel case without project name prefix

* Good, because it leads to the shortest possible name
* Bad, because it is harder to read if names include all caps
* Bad, because can be easily confused with similarly named graphics from a different project
* Bad, because it requires chorded keystrokes

### Dasherization without project name prefix

* Good, because it is easier to read if names include all caps
* Good, because it does not require chorded keystrokes
* Bad, because can be easily confused with similarly named graphics from a different project
* Bad, because it leads to longer names

### Camel case with project name prefix
